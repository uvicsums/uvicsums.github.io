    <h3>Candidate Write-ups</h3>
    <b>Hudson Gaudreault (President)</b><br>
    Hi! My name is Hudson and I am running to be re-elected as SUMS President. I am currently a fourth-year mathematics undergraduate student here at UVic.
    During my first term as President, I oversaw our extremely hard-working and talented executive as we worked to revive SUMS as an organization.
    Now that we are once again up and running, if re-elected, I will work with our executive on a strategy to grow SUMS and on holding fun and
    frequent events (both academically and socially focused). <br><br>
    <b>Maya Mishra (Vice-President)</b><br>
    Hi everyone I am Maya and I am in fourth year math. I am running to be vp… outside of math I love riding horses and I am currently learning German :)
    as vp I will advocate for desired course offerings, opportunities to meet other math/stats majors, and have our first e day!! 
    Thank you for reading.<br><br>
    <b>Paula Mali (Director of Outreach)</b><br>
    Hello! I'm Paula, a 4th-ish year student in the Biology and Mathematics & Statistics program. I only switched programs last year, so now I am very eager to get more involved in the department. 
    I hope to bring my experience of student leadership (from organizations such as BUGS) to my role as Director of Outreach to help SUMS and the math/stat community grow!
    <b>Elitza Wise (Director of Marketing)</b><br>
    Hi my name is Elitza! I am in my 4th year of math honours with a stats minor, and I’m running to be Director of Marketing for SUMS. In my spare time I love to bake, read, and travel.
